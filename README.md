# Slimeology: The Discovery of Slime

## Primer

Explore the world in search of more varieties of slime than ever! Enjoy an expanded block palette for both building and redstoning! 

Custom advancements will guide you along every step of the way. 

Requires Auto Config to run.

## Coloured Slimes

The natural slimy interstitia have strengthened, allowing these new slimes to spawn on the surface in slime chunks. No more relying on quarrying out large underground chambers and torching caves, nor consulting third-party apps. Just look around for bouncy silhouettes at night time, and keep an eye on the moon. Explore the biomes of the world to collect all the colours!

*The biomes to which Coloured Slimes are allocated for spawning can be adjusted via config.*

## Coloured Slime Blocks and Coloured Slimeballs

More sticky blocks for jumping! For building! For redstoning! They can do everything a vanilla Slime Block can do like bouncing stuff, sticking to stuff, launching entities and transmitting redstone. They will stick to other blocks or their own colours when moved by a piston, but won’t stick to different colours or to Honey Blocks.

Craft 9 Coloured Slimeballs into a Coloured Slime Block, just like the vanilla recipe.

A Coloured Slime Block can be crafted by into 9 Coloured Slimeballs as well.

### Rainbow Slime Block

A block that sticks to everything, even other Coloured Slime Blocks and Honey Blocks. Might be quite useful, but user beware. Craft 9 of any type of Coloured Slime Block or the vanilla Slime Block to get the Rainbow Slime Block.

### Cauldron Washing

Just like Shulker Box washing! If you want to obtain the vanilla Slime Block, fill a Cauldron with water and right-click it to wash away the colour from the Coloured Slime Block. It’s functional, but you wonder if there’s a better way.

### Bleaching Brush

If you’ve collected a lot of Coloured Slime Blocks and wish that you could make use of the dyes inside, you’re in luck. You can scrub out the dye with the help of some water. 

With some Sticks, String, Wool and a Slimeball, first craft a Bleaching Brush.

Then place some Coloured Slime Blocks directly around water as if you were farming (i.e. corner blocks are included).

Then right-click to clean the Coloured Slime Block and scrape out a dye! Again, you wonder if there’s a more efficient way to extract dyes from Coloured Slime Blocks.\

(You may ask, but how do I get a normal Slimeball without the Bleaching Brush? Well, Coloured Slimes spawn in slime chunks in the first place.)

## Slimy Sand

Saturating a Sand Block with Slime combines the falling behaviour of Sand with the stickiness of the Slime Block. When placed next to a floating block, the Slimy Sand will fall down while dragging down the adjacent block until either block stops falling. A new convenient way of block transportation, or even block breaking.

## Slimy Glass

Smelt Slimy Sand in a furnace to obtain a new type of glass with a slimy texture and sticky properties. Useful if Slime Blocks aren’t transparent enough, or if you want a little more variety in windows.

## Coloured Sticky Pistons

Crafted with a Coloured Slimeball and a Piston. However, the coloured slime spreads out more than vanilla slime over the piston head, staining the top as well as the sides. It could be useful for organising redstone contraptions. Coloured Sticky Pistons stick to all blocks.
